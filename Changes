0.018 2015-01-29 TEODESIAN
    - Better finding of $HOME in testrail-report and the prove plugin for cross-platform usage

0.017 2015-01-29 TEODESIAN
    - Explicitly import List::Util in TestRail::API, this causes issues on some perls

0.016 2015-01-26 TEODESIAN
    - Use correct perl when invoking scripts to fix cpantesters failures.
    - Use parent instead of base, this confuses older perls

0.015 2015-01-25 TEODESIAN
    - Remove all usage of IO::Capture for more concise verbose test output.  Makes cpantesters/travis wig out?

0.014 2015-01-23 TEODESIAN
    - Fixed issue where testrail-report would not parse the results of multiple tests in a TAP file or stream.
    - Fixed issue where testrail-report would erroneously attempt to report the results of subtests.
    - Parse TODO/SKIP messages correctly, add todo reason to the test notes
    - Set SKIP_ALL tests status correctly
    - Add TestRail::API::getConfigurations method
    - Add TestRail::API::getChildRuns and getChildRunByName methods to extract runs from plans when passed names
    - Add ability to pass version to testrail-report & App::Prove::Plugin::TestRail

0.013 2015-01-04 TEODESIAN
    - Remove usage of Types::Serialiser, and use JSON::MaybeXS (odd intermittent errors on testers)
    - Remove checking of user being in getUsers, this won't work with external (LDAP) auth

0.012 2014-12-30 TEODESIAN
    - DZIL tidying
    - Re-enabled some of the critic tests, fixed a few related issues
    - Improve safety of constructor, try to die with helpful messages as soon as possible
    - Add class usage checks and test for that as author tests

    - Add fatal type checking of inputs for all methods, add test to make sure exceptions thrown correctly
    - Add offset argument to getTestResults call.
    - Add (auto-generated) mock class so we don't have to skip practically all of TestRail-API.t
    - Add getTestResultFieldByName method and relevant tests
    - Add Test::Rail::Parser and App::Prove::Plugin::TestRail so you can upload results
    - Add testrail-report binary for those who want to run on static TAP rather than 'do it live' with prove -P
